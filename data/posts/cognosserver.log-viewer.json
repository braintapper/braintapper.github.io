At some point I may make a separate app that reads audit logs, but I was focused at solving the pain point I had at the moment.\r\n\r\nIn terms of data storage, none of the log files you load are stored on any server. I use the browser's built in data store (works similar to a cookie), and I've provided a mechanism for you to wipe the database.\r\n\r\nIn terms of performance, since everything is running in a browser, the bigger the file, the slower it will be to load and process. Also, I've only tested it with Cognos 11.1.x logs. No guarantees it will work on older logs.\r\n\r\nThis app wasn't written to be sold or anything, so I only did a minimal amount of testing and trapping. Keep the old adage of \"garbage in, garbage out\" in mind when using it.\r\n\r\nYou can report issues here: https://github.com/bt-apps/cognos_log_viewer/issues but there's no guarantee I'll address them, as this was only designed for my specific needs and not be some huge do-it-all application.\r\n\r\nEnjoy!",
