A <em>long</em> while, actually.</p> <p>It's been a long time coming, but I forced myself over the holidays to revamp the site, and here it is.</p> <p>Things are going to be rough for a little while, as this is a work in progress, and I've opted to go live with a buggy site as opposed to leaving a placeholder page up. This should force me to iterate more quickly and more often.</p> <p>So before I rebuilt the site, I went through a lot of hand-wringing deciding how to publish this site.</p> <p>Should I use a static generator like Jekyll? A GUI type tool like MarsEdit? Should I write my own tool? Wordpress (no f-ing way)? A hosted site like Squarespace?</p> <p>I ended up choosing a hodgepodge of <a href=https://svelte.dev/ >Svelte</a> and <a href=https://sapper.svelte.dev/ >Sapper</a>, with some preprocessing using <a href=https://gulpjs.com/ >Gulp</a>. I've already been immersing myself in Svelte for the past couple of months, so I figured I may as well stick with that for my site too. Once the site is somewhat stable, I'll try to write up a blog post on what I do to build this site. TLDR; I basically write my content as markdown posts, and have a script to process them into something consumable for my Svelte app.</p> <p>The site's main focus is the blog, but I will have some evergreen content in the form of <a href=/articles>articles</a> that can help boost your productivity. I plan to publish my list of "must have" software and services, among other things.</p> <p>The blog will be mostly made up of a hodgepodge of technical topics, ranging from Cognos, Node, Database and other topics that I find interesting.</p> <p>In the meantime, click on the RSS link at the top of the page to keep up with my new content.</p> <p>Cheers!</p> </article> </section> <footer class=svelte-z3516v> <p class=svelte-z3516v>Hand crafted with <a href=https://svelte.dev/ target=new>Svelte</a>, <a href=https://sapper.svelte.dev/ target=new>Sapper</a> and <a href=https://lunrjs.com target=new>Lunr.js</a>.
