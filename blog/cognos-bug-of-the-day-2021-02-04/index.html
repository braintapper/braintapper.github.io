    <h2>February 4, 2021 by Steven Ng</h2></header>
  <p>Experienced a nice juicy user interface bug in the Administration Console today. It&#39;s pretty obscure and specific, but knowing about it will prevent you from chasing down the wrong paths in terms of root cause analysis.</p>
<p>This little UI issue is a sanity breaker though, as it will have you second guessing what you did.</p>
<p>Standard checkbox behaviour in a web browser is that <a href="https://svelte.dev/repl/cec15802392e470eb12efc01ac646ab0?version=3.32.1">clicking on the label for a checkbox</a> will toggle its state from checked to unchecked and vice versa. Since the label is usually a much bigger target to click on than the checkbox, you might prefer to click on the label over the checkbox itself. </p>
<p>In the Cognos Administration console, if you click on a checkbox&#39;s label to <strong>disable</strong> an entry, it works perfectly fine. But if you click on the checkbox&#39;s label to <strong>enable</strong> an item, it doesn&#39;t save the change. Note that the &quot;Hide this entry&quot; checkbox value saves fine, so it is isolated to the &quot;Disable this entry&quot; checkbox label.</p>

<p>Your first thought is likely to be &quot;Well, this feature has been around forever, they&#39;ve tested all edge cases. It can&#39;t be a UI bug, since I did the same thing to enable it and it worked.&quot;  You might be thinking maybe it&#39;s a permissions or capabilities issue. Surprise, surprise, it is indeed a user interface bug (reproducible in 11.1.7 and 11.1.4).</p>
<p>So let me save you a bit of time hunting this issue down, because searching for &quot;Cognos 11 can&#39;t enable printer&quot; or whichever item you&#39;re trying to enable probably won&#39;t give you a very good result (unless this blog post shows up, haha).</p>
<p>Lucky for us, there is a workaround. You can re-enable the item by clicking on <strong>the checkbox itself</strong> and then saving. </p>
<p>I&#39;m not in the habit of figuring out someone else&#39;s bugs, but curiosity got the best of me, so I looked at the markup in my browser&#39;s developer tools. If you&#39;re not into coding, you&#39;ll probably want to skip the next bit and be on your merry way.</p>
<p>It looks like the checkbox is inside a table, and when you click outside of the checkbox, the <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> tag has an <code>onclick</code> event that changes state of the checkbox (it wasn&#39;t the label after all). The problem is that the value is tracked not in the checkbox control, but in a hidden text field (which is storing the value being saved to the content store), and that field isn&#39;t changed to <code>false</code> when the &quot;Disable this entry&quot; checkbox is checked (it is for the &quot;Hide this Entry&quot; table click though).</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure the markup is quite old (the heavy use of tables is a good indicator), as backwards compatibility with Internet Explorer is still a thing in the enterprise world, even today. Having said that, by modern web coding standards, the amount of code being used to manage a boolean state on a checkbox is absolutely bonkers.</p>
