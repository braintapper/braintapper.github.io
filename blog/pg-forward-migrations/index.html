<article type="content"><header><h1><a rel="prefetch" href="/blog/pg-forward-migrations">So I Wrote a Database Migrations NPM</a></h1>
    <h2>December 30, 2019 by Steven Ng</h2></header>
  <p>I&#39;ve been working on making Docker containers of my personal Nodejs projects lately, and for those that rely on a relational database (namely Postgresql), I wanted to be able to run <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration">database migrations</a> on them locally to make updates easier. To be clear, I&#39;m not talking about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_migration">data migrations</a>, which are a completely different thing.</p>
<p>For database migrations outside of Ruby on Rails, I&#39;ve been using <a href="http://www.liquibase.org/">Liquibase</a>, and more recently, <a href="https://flywaydb.org/">Flyway</a>. They&#39;re both perfectly fine tools, but they also require Java, which means one may need to <a href="https://www.itjungle.com/2019/04/03/ibm-clarifies-java-options-following-oracle-license-crackdown/">consider the implications of how Java licenses work</a>.</p>
<p>As it relates to migrations, I subscribe to the <a href="https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/05/03/stack-overflow-how-we-do-deployment-2016-edition/#database-migrations">forward migrations only philosophy</a>, which means my requirements are relatively simple. All I need to do is scan a pre-specified directory of SQL files and run only the new SQL files. The onus is on me for providing clean, error-free SQL files, so I don&#39;t need to make a migration tool very smart.</p>
<p>I did look at existing libraries on NPMJS, but I didn&#39;t see any having a workflow similar to Flyway, which has been my tool of choice.</p>
<p>You might be getting the impression that I suffer from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here">NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome</a>, and you could be right. But my experience with some software is that there are always some elements that I find incredibly frustrating or incompatible with the way I work, and I end up spending significantly more time working around those issues than I would have if I had just written something from scratch.</p>
<p>My NPM, named <a href="https://github.com/braintapper/pg-forward-migrations">pg-forward-migrations</a> is designed to do one very specific task well, and took a few hours to write. I spent more time figuring out how to use Liquibase the first time I used it, so in this particular case, the NIH concern is a wash.</p>
<p>All this NPM does is run sequence of SQL statements against a Postgresql database. The workflow is inspired by Flyway in that it uses an easy-to-remember naming convention, and it tracks completed migrations by writing to a migration table in the target database. That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not rocket science, nor is it attempting to be a replacement for a multi-platform, enterprise-class database migration tool.</p>
<p>At some point, I will probably use this NPM to create command line executable, but at the moment, it&#39;s not a priority.</p>
<p>In any case, if you&#39;ve got a need for a forward migration tool for Postgresql/Node, give the NPM a whirl.</p>
