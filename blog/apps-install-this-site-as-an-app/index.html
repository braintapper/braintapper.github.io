  <h1 id="confessions-of-a-tab-hoarder">Confessions of a Tab Hoarder</h1>
<p>I&#39;ve been using <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge">Edge Chromium</a> as my primary browser on Windows for quite some time now, and I like it <em>a lot</em>. In the past few months, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve opened up Chrome on Windows except by mistake. Honestly, I don&#39;t miss Chrome at all.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always had a bad habit of having too many tabs open (often more than 50). More often than not, instead of trying to find an existing tab, I&#39;ll just open a duplicate, which exacerbates my problem.</p>
<h1 id="roll-your-own-pwa">Roll Your Own PWA</h1>
<p>Edge has a very cool feature that lets you roll your own PWA (<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/pwa">progressive web application</a>) out of a web site. In other words, it will create a single-site application that is accessible from the Windows Start menu. It also means that the generated PWA gets its own spot on your taskbar, using the site&#39;s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Favicon">favicon</a> as the icon. No more tab hunting.</p>
<p>For a tab hoarder like me, this is a life changing feature. I have a ton of web apps that I&#39;m constantly using throughout the day, so this makes life a lot easier.</p>
<p>As always, there&#39;s a catch. The feature doesn&#39;t work great with all sites/web apps. If the web app you&#39;re using has to proliferate new tabs or windows, it&#39;s not a great candidate, as those tabs/windows will open up in Edge. For example, if you&#39;re thinking this technique is a great way to use Dropbox Paper or Google Apps<sup>1</sup>, you&#39;re wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you&#39;re using it for something like Feedly, Github or PGAdmin4, it&#39;s great. I have a lot of containerized web apps like <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">PiHole</a> that work great as PWAs.</p>
<p>So how do you enable this magical feature?</p>
<p>If you&#39;re running Edge for Chromium, just browse to a site (ideally, you go to the exact page you want to start from, since that will be the page you see when launching the PWA), go to the menu, <code>Apps</code> &gt; <code>Install this site as an app</code>. Give the app a new name if the default isn&#39;t to your liking, and <strong>bam</strong>, you&#39;re done!</p>
