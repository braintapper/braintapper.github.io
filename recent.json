    "__content": "\n\n# Get Off My Lawn\n\nI find that technical choices can be an especially polarizing topic among techies, especially with the newer generation.\n\nWhile tech has never been immune from the \"smartest guy in the room\" syndrome, programming language debates can often be fatiguing to watch, and soul sucking to engage in.\n\nSo here's my old geezer \"you don't know how good you have it\" lecture. When I was coming up in the tech industry three decades ago, there were only a handful of programming languages you could get gainful employment in. It was usually a some variant of C, a mainframe language, Java, or for a time Visual Basic. Everything else was dismissed by the smartest guys in the room as a \"toy language\".\n\nToday, you can get gainful employment in a wide variety of languages. In addition to the old standbys, Python, Ruby, Javascript, Typescript, Erlang, Go, Swift and a pile of other languages are pervasive and popular. I think it's <i><b>great</i></b> that there are so many acceptable language options today.\n\nIf you've been watching the Javascript world, you'll probably notice that everyone in the know has jumped onto the [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) bandwagon over the past few years.\n\nI don't have any quibbles with Typescript, but I haven't jumped on that bandwagon... <i><b>yet</b></i>. I'm still using [Coffeescript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CoffeeScript). If you're not familiar with [Coffeescript](https://coffeescript.org/), it's a language written in Javascript that compiles into Javascript. Wait, what?\n\n# Coffeescript\n\nThis description will date me, but Coffeescript is essentially Javascript [shorthand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shorthand). It lets you to write Javascript with a Ruby-ish/Python-ish syntax. Coffeescript is sweetened by a pack of [syntactic sugar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syntactic_sugar) resulting from the elimination of semicolons and braces as well as the improved readability of nested logic using indented whitespace.\n\nFor example, this Coffeescript snippet:\n\n```\npalette =\n  \"gray\" : [\"#dee2e6\",\"#ced4da\",\"#adb5bd\",\"#868e96\",\"#495057\",\"#343a40\",\"#212529\"]\n  \"purple\" : [\"#e5dbff\",\"#d0bfff\",\"#b197fc\",\"#9775fa\",\"#845ef7\",\"#7048e8\",\"#5f3dc4\"]\n  \"blue\" : [\"#dbe4ff\",\"#bac8ff\",\"#91a7ff\",\"#5c7cfa\",\"#4c6ef5\",\"#3b5bdb\",\"#364fc7\"]\n  \"green\" : [\"#c3fae8\",\"#63e6be\",\"#20c997\",\"#12b886\",\"#0ca678\",\"#099268\",\"#087f5b\"]\n  \"yellow\" : [\"#fff3bf\",\"#ffec99\",\"#ffe066\",\"#ffd43b\",\"#fcc419\",\"#fab005\",\"#f59f00\"]\n  \"orange\" : [\"#ffe8cc\",\"#ffc078\",\"#ffa94d\",\"#fd7e14\",\"#f76707\",\"#e8590c\",\"#d9480f\"]\n  \"red\" : [\"#ffe3e3\",\"#ffa8a8\",\"#ff8787\",\"#fa5252\",\"#f03e3e\",\"#e03131\",\"#c92a2a\"]\n\ncolors = Object.keys(palette)\n\nshades = [\"lightest\",\"lighter\",\"light\", \"\", \"dark\", \"darker\", \"darkest\"]\n\nforeground = (shade,background)->\n  color = \"#ffffff\"\n  switch shade\n    when \"lightest\",\"lighter\",\"light\"\n      color = \"#495057\"\n    when \"\"\n      if background == \"yellow\" then color = \"#495057\"\n    when \"dark\"\n      if background == \"yellow\" then color = \"#495057\"\n  color\n```\n\nCompiles to this:\n\n```\nvar colors, foreground, palette, shades;\n\npalette = {\n  \"gray\": [\"#dee2e6\", \"#ced4da\", \"#adb5bd\", \"#868e96\", \"#495057\", \"#343a40\", \"#212529\"],\n  \"purple\": [\"#e5dbff\", \"#d0bfff\", \"#b197fc\", \"#9775fa\", \"#845ef7\", \"#7048e8\", \"#5f3dc4\"],\n  \"blue\": [\"#dbe4ff\", \"#bac8ff\", \"#91a7ff\", \"#5c7cfa\", \"#4c6ef5\", \"#3b5bdb\", \"#364fc7\"],\n  \"green\": [\"#c3fae8\", \"#63e6be\", \"#20c997\", \"#12b886\", \"#0ca678\", \"#099268\", \"#087f5b\"],\n  \"yellow\": [\"#fff3bf\", \"#ffec99\", \"#ffe066\", \"#ffd43b\", \"#fcc419\", \"#fab005\", \"#f59f00\"],\n  \"orange\": [\"#ffe8cc\", \"#ffc078\", \"#ffa94d\", \"#fd7e14\", \"#f76707\", \"#e8590c\", \"#d9480f\"],\n  \"red\": [\"#ffe3e3\", \"#ffa8a8\", \"#ff8787\", \"#fa5252\", \"#f03e3e\", \"#e03131\", \"#c92a2a\"]\n};\n\ncolors = Object.keys(palette);\n\nshades = [\"lightest\", \"lighter\", \"light\", \"\", \"dark\", \"darker\", \"darkest\"];\n\nforeground = function(shade, background) {\n  var color;\n  color = \"#ffffff\";\n  switch (shade) {\n    case \"lightest\":\n    case \"lighter\":\n    case \"light\":\n      color = \"#495057\";\n      break;\n    case \"\":\n      if (background === \"yellow\") {\n        color = \"#495057\";\n      }\n      break;\n    case \"dark\":\n      if (background === \"yellow\") {\n        color = \"#495057\";\n      }\n  }\n  return color;\n};\n```\n\nYou'll notice that the Coffeescript code is terser, which in my opinion, makes it more readable.\n\nCoffeescript, however, does <b>not</b> absolve you of needing to know any Javascript, as debugging still requires full Javascript fluency. As I mentioned, <b><i>Coffeescript is shorthand for Javascript, but not a replacement</i></b>.\n\n# Why?\n\nSo why do I still use Coffeescript, even though it's 2020 and there are arguably better (and inarguably more popular) options?\n\nWell, I started using Coffeescript when I started to do Ruby on Rails development roughly 10 years ago. If you've spent any time doing RoR, you'll know that indented syntax languages like [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/) and [Haml](http://haml.info/) are incredibly popular in that world. SASS and Haml let you write CSS and HTML without becoming muddled with braces, semicolons or open and close tags. With Rails 3.1, Coffeescript adoption became even more widespread among RoR devs.\n\nUsing Coffeescript with Rails has real benefits, as Coffeescript code has a lot of similarities to Ruby, which means less mental \"mode switching\" when jumping back and forth between front-end and back-end code, which makes it feel like you're writing in the same language across the breadth of your entire application.\n\nSo back to the question of \"why\", I still use Coffeescript today because it allows me to translates my thoughts into code faster without worrying about details like braces and semicolons. The use of whitespace also makes the code incredibly easy to read for me, which makes debugging much faster. The primary cost of this language is that it needs to be compiled (which for me happens in near real time, since I use a [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp) script to compile my code when files change. Now that I'm working with [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), which is a compiled web development platform, the notion of Coffeescript's compilation step as an inconvenience is moot, as Svelte requires compilation anyways. I simply include Coffeescript as a seamless preprocessing step in my Svelte workflow.\n\n# Looking Forward\n\nI have been tempted to switch to Javascript (or even Typescript) now that I've been using Svelte, mainly because of some Coffeescript-unfriendly idiosyncracies in Svelte (i.e., `export let`, `let` and `$: { someCode}`).  Those idiosyncracies, however, are easily solved with the use of backticks, which in Coffescript, lets you pass through raw Javascript in your Coffeescript code.\n\nSo while my use of Coffeescript might be considered <i><b>passé</b></i> to some, I still find it to be a valuable part of my toolchain, because I am more efficient and productive with it. Having said that, I'm not at all ignorant or resistant to change. Myself, I'm partial to tools that work the way I think, and sometimes timing matters. Industry-wide preferences often become replaced with even newer ones.\n\nFor example, I've been looking to move away from AngularJS for newer web projects for some time. I considered Angular (AngularJS's successor whose name is not at all confusing, smirk), React and Vue. I was about to jump on the Vue bandwagon until I heard about the Svelte 3 announcement, and was simply blown away by how it ticked all the boxes that I was looking for in an AngularJS replacement. Had I made my choice earlier, I'd be a Vue developer right now. Timing affects outcomes.\n\nSo yes, I could adopt Typescript now, but I need some convincing that at some point Typescript won't fall out of favor of something newer, faster and better. In the end, whether you're using Coffeescript or Typescript, you're still compiling that language to plain old Javascript, since that's what runs on browsers and NodeJS. So why not stick to the tool that works best for you, whatever that may be?\n",

I simply include Coffeescript as a seamless preprocessing step in my Svelte workflow.</p>\n<h1 id=\"looking-forward\">Looking Forward</h1>\n<p>I have been tempted to switch to Javascript (or even Typescript) now that I&#39;ve been using Svelte, mainly because of some Coffeescript-unfriendly idiosyncracies in Svelte (i.e., <code>export let</code>, <code>let</code> and <code>$: { someCode}</code>).  Those idiosyncracies, however, are easily solved with the use of backticks, which in Coffescript, lets you pass through raw Javascript in your Coffeescript code.</p>\n<p>So while my use of Coffeescript might be considered <i><b>passé</b></i> to some, I still find it to be a valuable part of my toolchain, because I am more efficient and productive with it. Having said that, I&#39;m not at all ignorant or resistant to change. Myself, I&#39;m partial to tools that work the way I think, and sometimes timing matters. Industry-wide preferences often become replaced with even newer ones.</p>\n<p>For example, I&#39;ve been looking to move away from AngularJS for newer web projects for some time. I considered Angular (AngularJS&#39;s successor whose name is not at all confusing, smirk), React and Vue. I was about to jump on the Vue bandwagon until I heard about the Svelte 3 announcement, and was simply blown away by how it ticked all the boxes that I was looking for in an AngularJS replacement. Had I made my choice earlier, I&#39;d be a Vue developer right now. Timing affects outcomes.</p>\n<p>So yes, I could adopt Typescript now, but I need some convincing that at some point Typescript won&#39;t fall out of favor of something newer, faster and better. In the end, whether you&#39;re using Coffeescript or Typescript, you&#39;re still compiling that language to plain old Javascript, since that&#39;s what runs on browsers and NodeJS. So why not stick to the tool that works best for you, whatever that may be?</p>\n",

    "__content": "\n# Note Taking Hell\n\nIt's no secret that I've been hunting for the \"perfect\" note taking application for years now.\n\nI dropped Evernote a few years ago as a multi-purpose tool, and have been trying to find a replacement ever since.\n\nNote taking is a very personal in that you develop some very specific tool and/or process preferences that you don't really want to compromise on. What works for one person may not work for another.\n\n\n# My Own Criteria\n\nFor me, my core requirements, in no particular order (they are numbered for reference), are/*were*:\n\n\n1. A Windows native desktop client\n2. The ability to have my notes in a hierarchical file structure that was available in a tree view (more important on the desktop than mobile)\n3. Cloud sync or storage\n4. Live conversion from [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) to formatted text *without* having a preview pane\n5. Ability to *access* and *read* my notes from my Android phone. Editing and creating is only a *nice to have*, since I'm pretty much useless with a touchscreen keyboard.\n6. The occasional ability to collaborate on notes/docs with others (this one's not a deal breaker)\n\nCriteria that I *thought* were important but ended up being unimportant:\n\n\n- Web clipping\n- Pen support\n\nI always found that web clipping polluted my notes a little, and I recently switched to using [Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/en) for all my bookmarks and web clippings. Wallabag is very similar to Pocket, and it's been working well for me so far.\n\nFor years, I've had this crazy notion that I wanted an electronic version of the paper notebook that I bring to meetings. The problem is that the available solutions work better in my imagination than they do in real life. I've pretty much given up on the idea of a stylus-based tool, and no longer consider it meaningful criteria in determining what type of note taking tool(s) I use.\n\n\n# Options I Considered\n\nWith my criteria considered, some picks I tried and considered were:\n\n\n- A folder full of Markdown files\n- OneNote\n- Google Docs\n- [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/)\n- [WikiJS](https://wiki.js.org/)\n- [Bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/)\n- [Dokuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki)\n- [MarkText](https://marktext.app/)\n\nThe one option that did look good to me was [Bear.app](https://bear.app/), but it's really only for people in the Apple ecosystem, which I'm no longer a part of.\n\nEven if they do eventually support Windows and Android, I don't know that I'd switch to Bear, given my experience with applications that are Apple-centric. For example, I've always felt like the Windows and Android clients for 1Password were second-class citizens in terms of the product line.\n\n\n## A folder full of Markdown files\n\nOne of the first things I tried was a Dropbox folder full of notes using a text editor like [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/). This method wasn't horrible, but the problem is that I have multiple text editors open at any given time, and it got hard finding the right window. Having said that, the solution I'm using now has the same problem, except within a web browser.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 5\n\n\n## OneNote\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with OneNote. On one hand, it's very powerful, on the other hand, it has so many user interface quirks that drive me bonkers. It's also not really a Markdown centric tool, even though it has a few Markdown-like shortcuts, like using asterisks to start bullet lists.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 4 (limited), 5, 6\n\n\n## Google Docs\n\nGoogle Docs is fine, but the experience feels more like using a traditional word processor than a note taking tool. Also, it's not Markdown centric.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 2, 3, 4 (limited), 5, 6\n\n\n## Joplin\n\nJoplin is a Markdown centric alternative to Evernote. It lets you sync your notes using Dropbox. It's pretty good, and has a web clipper that works quite well. I think the main weakness of Joplin is that it it doesn’t do live Markdown conversion the way I’d like it to.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 5\n\n\n## WikiJS\n\nWikiJS is a self-hosted wiki. It has a *lot* of potential, but as of the time of writing, it's not quite there yet for me to want to use it daily. To be able to use it outside of my LAN, however, I'd have to open up a firewall port, or host it on a server somewhere, which is something I’m not interested in doing.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6\n\n\n## Bookstack\n\nBookstack must be *the* most recommended note taking tool on [/r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted). I gave it a shot, bailed, and then gave it a shot again. For note taking, it had way too many quirks with respect to the user interface that just annoyed the hell out of me. If, however, I was authoring a book, it would probably be my first choice for that task.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6\n\n\n## Dokuwiki\n\nDokuwiki is a simple file based Wiki. It's ok, but I struggled with the idea of using it every day. It just wasn't very enjoyable to use.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6\n\n\n## MarkText\n\nMarkText is similar to Bear, but lacking much of Bear's polish. It has a lot of potential, but it's still too buggy and quirky at the time of writing.\n\nRequirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5\n\n\n# No Clear Winners\n\nSo there is obviously no tool that checks all of my 6 main requirements completely. Short of writing my own tool (which I considered, but decided I had other projects more worthy of my time), I had to give up on 100% coverage of my requirements. The solution I ultimately choose would obviously require me to compromise on what I want.\n\n\n# Revisiting Paper\n\nI tried Paper way back when Dropbox announced it, but honestly, it left no lasting impression on me.\n\nI gave it another cursory shot a few weeks ago (after upgrading to a paid Dropbox subscription), and discovered that its live Markdown conversion is *excellent*. It is definitely better than MarkText in this regard.\n\nIt wasn't until I had to collaborate on a server installation document that I was truly sold on Paper.\nBefore I get into the nuts and bolts of Paper, the requirements it satisfies are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nRight now, there's no desktop client that's been released to the public. I'm hoping they release *something*, even if it's just an Electron app. I need something that occupies its own button on my taskbar instead of having to cycle through my browser windows to find my Notes. Having said that, in daily use, I am finding that Paper is a fantastic note taking tool.\n\n\n## Markdown Support\n\nThe live conversion of Markdown works very well in Paper. The reason why Markdown support is so important to me is that it saves me a lot of time. When I'm writing documentation, the ability to style documents using markup alone is incredibly powerful. There is no mousing around for styling or setting heading levels. I find pumping out documentation to be a noticeably faster and smoother experience.\n\nSo not only do I now use Paper for notes, I also use it for work-related documents.\n\nWhere I can, I'm actually writing documentation in Paper and exporting to Word or PDF.\nI can say without any reservations that the editing experience in Paper is the main driver for it being my daily writing tool, *in spite* of any glaring weaknesses it may have.\n\n\n\n## Other Useful Features and Details\n\nThe checklist feature in Dropbox is pretty darned cool. You can assign dates and people to checklist items, and get notifications too. Paper can also aggregate the checklists on all your Paper documents into a single view.\n\nThe implementation of this feature has me rethinking how I approach project management tools in general. I still have to do some practical experiments with Paper in this regard, but I have a feeling that it can do what I need, which is saying a lot.\n\nThere's a Timeline feature that lets you insert a horizontal timeline, which can be used to create a pseudo Gantt view. This could be a great feature for collaborating on larger projects.\n\nLike Word and Google Docs, Paper has popular features like commenting, version history, and live collaboration.\n\nIt may sound corny, but the default stylesheet for the document is really nice. Not Bear nice, but a close second. I absolutely hate the default stylesheets in Word, Onenote and most other tools.\nWhen writing long documents, you get a hiearchy map on the right side of the Paper document to allow you to jump quickly to headings in your document.\n\nYou can export your document to Word for finalization, or if you don't need to make any edits, you can export your document to PDF.\n\nThere's a presentation mode for your document, but I haven't found a good use for that feature.\n\n\n\n## Deficiencies\n\nWhile I am really liking Paper *a lot*, the user experience isn't all sunshine and rainbows. If the editing experience were not so good, I would consider some of these deficiencies to be deal breakers:\n\n\n- The Android app experience is horrible. You can't dig for a file based on location. It's basically an \"all\" or \"favorites\" view. This is fixable, but I have to admit, it is very annoying.\n- No desktop application. At any given moment, I have way too many browser windows open, each having too many tabs. Finding the window containing a Paper document is an exercise in patience. If I could at least have a dedicated Paper button in my task bar, that would save me a lot of stress.\n- Paper documents are server-side documents. They are not real documents like Word or text documents. In your local Dropbox folders, the files are basically links to the Paper web app. If you have any hangups about having readable local copies, you're going to absolutely hate this about Paper. If your Internet goes out or the Paper service goes down, you are f-ed. I think a Desktop app that can have local copies would mitigate any concerns related to this.\n- No easy conversion feature for existing Markdown documents. I couldn't find any way to convert my existing Markdown notes to paper short of opening the file, pasting it a new Paper document and deleting the Markdown file.\n\n\n# Verdict\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, whether Paper is ideal for you depends on your own preferences. When it came out in 2015, I thought very little to nothing about it. I was relatively unimpressed.\n\nYears later, after giving it a new attempt, I find the application to be a revelation. It has improved so much that it has quickly become my writing tool of choice. In fact, the draft of this blog was written in Paper and pasted into my static site generator.\n\nPaper may not be for you, but if you care about using Markdown for writing, you should definitely give it another shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how good it is.\n",

I&#39;ve pretty much given up on the idea of a stylus-based tool, and no longer consider it meaningful criteria in determining what type of note taking tool(s) I use.</p>\n<h1 id=\"options-i-considered\">Options I Considered</h1>\n<p>With my criteria considered, some picks I tried and considered were:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A folder full of Markdown files</li>\n<li>OneNote</li>\n<li>Google Docs</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://joplinapp.org/\">Joplin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://wiki.js.org/\">WikiJS</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.bookstackapp.com/\">Bookstack</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki\">Dokuwiki</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://marktext.app/\">MarkText</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>The one option that did look good to me was <a href=\"https://bear.app/\">Bear.app</a>, but it&#39;s really only for people in the Apple ecosystem, which I&#39;m no longer a part of.</p>\n<p>Even if they do eventually support Windows and Android, I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d switch to Bear, given my experience with applications that are Apple-centric. For example, I&#39;ve always felt like the Windows and Android clients for 1Password were second-class citizens in terms of the product line.</p>\n<h2 id=\"a-folder-full-of-markdown-files\">A folder full of Markdown files</h2>\n<p>One of the first things I tried was a Dropbox folder full of notes using a text editor like <a href=\"https://www.sublimetext.com/\">Sublime Text</a>. This method wasn&#39;t horrible, but the problem is that I have multiple text editors open at any given time, and it got hard finding the right window. Having said that, the solution I&#39;m using now has the same problem, except within a web browser.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 5</p>\n<h2 id=\"onenote\">OneNote</h2>\n<p>I have a love/hate relationship with OneNote. On one hand, it&#39;s very powerful, on the other hand, it has so many user interface quirks that drive me bonkers. It&#39;s also not really a Markdown centric tool, even though it has a few Markdown-like shortcuts, like using asterisks to start bullet lists.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 4 (limited), 5, 6</p>\n<h2 id=\"google-docs\">Google Docs</h2>\n<p>Google Docs is fine, but the experience feels more like using a traditional word processor than a note taking tool. Also, it&#39;s not Markdown centric.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 2, 3, 4 (limited), 5, 6</p>\n<h2 id=\"joplin\">Joplin</h2>\n<p>Joplin is a Markdown centric alternative to Evernote. It lets you sync your notes using Dropbox. It&#39;s pretty good, and has a web clipper that works quite well. I think the main weakness of Joplin is that it it doesn’t do live Markdown conversion the way I’d like it to.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 5</p>\n<h2 id=\"wikijs\">WikiJS</h2>\n<p>WikiJS is a self-hosted wiki. It has a <em>lot</em> of potential, but as of the time of writing, it&#39;s not quite there yet for me to want to use it daily. To be able to use it outside of my LAN, however, I&#39;d have to open up a firewall port, or host it on a server somewhere, which is something I’m not interested in doing.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6</p>\n<h2 id=\"bookstack\">Bookstack</h2>\n<p>Bookstack must be <em>the</em> most recommended note taking tool on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted\">/r/selfhosted</a>. I gave it a shot, bailed, and then gave it a shot again. For note taking, it had way too many quirks with respect to the user interface that just annoyed the hell out of me. If, however, I was authoring a book, it would probably be my first choice for that task.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6</p>\n<h2 id=\"dokuwiki\">Dokuwiki</h2>\n<p>Dokuwiki is a simple file based Wiki. It&#39;s ok, but I struggled with the idea of using it every day. It just wasn&#39;t very enjoyable to use.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 2, 3, 5, 6</p>\n<h2 id=\"marktext\">MarkText</h2>\n<p>MarkText is similar to Bear, but lacking much of Bear&#39;s polish. It has a lot of potential, but it&#39;s still too buggy and quirky at the time of writing.</p>\n<p>Requirements satisfied: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5</p>\n<h1 id=\"no-clear-winners\">No Clear Winners</h1>\n<p>So there is obviously no tool that checks all of my 6 main requirements completely. Short of writing my own tool (which I considered, but decided I had other projects more worthy of my time), I had to give up on 100% coverage of my requirements. The solution I ultimately choose would obviously require me to compromise on what I want.</p>\n<h1 id=\"revisiting-paper\">Revisiting Paper</h1>\n<p>I tried Paper way back when Dropbox announced it, but honestly, it left no lasting impression on me.</p>\n<p>I gave it another cursory shot a few weeks ago (after upgrading to a paid Dropbox subscription), and discovered that its live Markdown conversion is <em>excellent</em>. It is definitely better than MarkText in this regard.</p>\n<p>It wasn&#39;t until I had to collaborate on a server installation document that I was truly sold on Paper.\nBefore I get into the nuts and bolts of Paper, the requirements it satisfies are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.\nRight now, there&#39;s no desktop client that&#39;s been released to the public. I&#39;m hoping they release <em>something</em>, even if it&#39;s just an Electron app. I need something that occupies its own button on my taskbar instead of having to cycle through my browser windows to find my Notes. Having said that, in daily use, I am finding that Paper is a fantastic note taking tool.</p>\n<h2 id=\"markdown-support\">Markdown Support</h2>\n<p>The live conversion of Markdown works very well in Paper. The reason why Markdown support is so important to me is that it saves me a lot of time. When I&#39;m writing documentation, the ability to style documents using markup alone is incredibly powerful. There is no mousing around for styling or setting heading levels. I find pumping out documentation to be a noticeably faster and smoother experience.</p>\n<p>So not only do I now use Paper for notes, I also use it for work-related documents.</p>\n<p>Where I can, I&#39;m actually writing documentation in Paper and exporting to Word or PDF.\nI can say without any reservations that the editing experience in Paper is the main driver for it being my daily writing tool, <em>in spite</em> of any glaring weaknesses it may have.</p>\n<h2 id=\"other-useful-features-and-details\">Other Useful Features and Details</h2>\n<p>The checklist feature in Dropbox is pretty darned cool. You can assign dates and people to checklist items, and get notifications too. Paper can also aggregate the checklists on all your Paper documents into a single view.</p>\n<p>The implementation of this feature has me rethinking how I approach project management tools in general. I still have to do some practical experiments with Paper in this regard, but I have a feeling that it can do what I need, which is saying a lot.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a Timeline feature that lets you insert a horizontal timeline, which can be used to create a pseudo Gantt view. This could be a great feature for collaborating on larger projects.</p>\n<p>Like Word and Google Docs, Paper has popular features like commenting, version history, and live collaboration.</p>\n<p>It may sound corny, but the default stylesheet for the document is really nice. Not Bear nice, but a close second. I absolutely hate the default stylesheets in Word, Onenote and most other tools.\nWhen writing long documents, you get a hiearchy map on the right side of the Paper document to allow you to jump quickly to headings in your document.</p>\n<p>You can export your document to Word for finalization, or if you don&#39;t need to make any edits, you can export your document to PDF.</p>\n<p>There&#39;s a presentation mode for your document, but I haven&#39;t found a good use for that feature.</p>\n<h2 id=\"deficiencies\">Deficiencies</h2>\n<p>While I am really liking Paper <em>a lot</em>, the user experience isn&#39;t all sunshine and rainbows. If the editing experience were not so good, I would consider some of these deficiencies to be deal breakers:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Android app experience is horrible. You can&#39;t dig for a file based on location. It&#39;s basically an &quot;all&quot; or &quot;favorites&quot; view. This is fixable, but I have to admit, it is very annoying.</li>\n<li>No desktop application. At any given moment, I have way too many browser windows open, each having too many tabs. Finding the window containing a Paper document is an exercise in patience. If I could at least have a dedicated Paper button in my task bar, that would save me a lot of stress.</li>\n<li>Paper documents are server-side documents. They are not real documents like Word or text documents. In your local Dropbox folders, the files are basically links to the Paper web app. If you have any hangups about having readable local copies, you&#39;re going to absolutely hate this about Paper. If your Internet goes out or the Paper service goes down, you are f-ed. I think a Desktop app that can have local copies would mitigate any concerns related to this.</li>\n<li>No easy conversion feature for existing Markdown documents. I couldn&#39;t find any way to convert my existing Markdown notes to paper short of opening the file, pasting it a new Paper document and deleting the Markdown file.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1 id=\"verdict\">Verdict</h1>\n<p>As I mentioned earlier, whether Paper is ideal for you depends on your own preferences. When it came out in 2015, I thought very little to nothing about it. I was relatively unimpressed.</p>\n<p>Years later, after giving it a new attempt, I find the application to be a revelation. It has improved so much that it has quickly become my writing tool of choice. In fact, the draft of this blog was written in Paper and pasted into my static site generator.</p>\n<p>Paper may not be for you, but if you care about using Markdown for writing, you should definitely give it another shot. You might be pleasantly surprised at how good it is.</p>\n",
