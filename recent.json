    "__content": "\r\nI've been working on making Docker containers of my personal Nodejs projects lately, and for those that rely on a relational database (namely Postgresql), I wanted to be able to run [database migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration) on them locally to make updates easier. To be clear, I'm not talking about [data migrations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_migration), which are a completely different thing.\r\n\r\nFor database migrations outside of Ruby on Rails, I've been using [Liquibase](http://www.liquibase.org/), and more recently, [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/). They're both perfectly fine tools, but they also require Java, which means one may need to [consider the implications of how Java licenses work](https://www.itjungle.com/2019/04/03/ibm-clarifies-java-options-following-oracle-license-crackdown/).\r\n\r\nAs it relates to migrations, I subscribe to the [forward migrations only philosophy](https://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/05/03/stack-overflow-how-we-do-deployment-2016-edition/#database-migrations), which means my requirements are relatively simple. All I need to do is scan a pre-specified directory of SQL files and run only the new SQL files. The onus is on me for providing clean, error-free SQL files, so I don't need to make a migration tool very smart.\r\n\r\nI did look at existing libraries on NPMJS, but I didn't see any having a workflow similar to Flyway, which has been my tool of choice.\r\n\r\nYou might be getting the impression that I suffer from [NIH (Not Invented Here) syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_invented_here), and you could be right. But my experience with some software is that there are always some elements that I find incredibly frustrating or incompatible with the way I work, and I end up spending significantly more time working around those issues than I would have if I had just written something from scratch.\r\n\r\nMy NPM, named [pg-forward-migrations](https://github.com/braintapper/pg-forward-migrations) is designed to do one very specific task well, and took a few hours to write. I spent more time figuring out how to use Liquibase the first time I used it, so in this particular case, the NIH concern is a wash.\r\n\r\nAll this NPM does is run sequence of SQL statements against a Postgresql database. The workflow is inspired by Flyway in that it uses an easy-to-remember naming convention, and it tracks completed migrations by writing to a migration table in the target database. That's it. It's not rocket science, nor is it attempting to be a replacement for a multi-platform, enterprise-class database migration tool.\r\n\r\nAt some point, I will probably use this NPM to create command line executable, but at the moment, it's not a priority.\r\n\r\nIn any case, if you've got a need for a forward migration tool for Postgresql/Node, give the NPM a whirl.\r\n",

This should force me to iterate more quickly and more often.\r\n\r\nSo before I rebuilt the site, I went through a lot of hand-wringing deciding how to publish this site.\r\n\r\nShould I use a static generator like Jekyll? A GUI type tool like MarsEdit? Should I write my own tool? Wordpress (no f-ing way)? A hosted site like Squarespace?\r\n\r\nI ended up choosing a hodgepodge of [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) and [Sapper](https://sapper.svelte.dev/), with some preprocessing using [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/). I've already been immersing myself in Svelte for the past couple of months, so I figured I may as well stick with that for my site too. Once the site is somewhat stable, I'll try to write up a blog post on what I do to build this site. TLDR; I basically write my content as markdown posts, and have a script to process them into something consumable for my Svelte app.\r\n\r\nThe site's main focus is the blog, but I will have some evergreen content in the form of [articles](/articles) that can help boost your productivity. I plan to publish my list of \"must have\" software and services, among other things.\r\n\r\nThe blog will be mostly made up of a hodgepodge of technical topics, ranging from Cognos, Node, Database and other topics that I find interesting.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, click on the RSS link at the top of the page to keep up with my new content.\r\n\r\nCheers!\r\n",
