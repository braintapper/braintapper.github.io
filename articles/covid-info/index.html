Right now, I don't get the perception that most people realize that <em>they will likely get the virus at some point</em>, and are somewhat dismissive of social distancing efforts. Social distancing efforts in the west right now are all about managing load on the health care system.</p> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/dSQztKXR6k0 width=560></iframe> <p>As it relates to health care capacity in Canada:</p> <ul> <li>As of 2018, <a href=https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.TOTL>Canada has a population of ~37M people</a></li> <li>For that population, <a href=https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/canada-covid-19-coronavirus-spread-hospital-surge-capacity-ventilators-1.5493178>Canada has 5000 ventilators spread across the country</a></li> <li>As of 2017, <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_hospital_beds>Canada has 2.52 beds per 1,000 people</a>, a number that has been steadily declining. Globally, we're ranked 36th in this metric. For comparison, China has 4.34/1000, Italy has 3.18/1000. At the top of the list are Japan and Korea, with 13.05/1000 and 12.27/1000, respectively.</li> <li>Keep in mind that many of those hospital beds are already occupied with other illnesses.</li> <li><a href=https://secure.cihi.ca/free_products/ICU_Report_EN.pdf>As of 2013-2014, it was estimated that Canada had 12.9 adult ICU beds per 100,000 population</a>. If you want to extrapolate, that's roughly 4800 adult ICU beds spread across the country. In reality, those beds aren't spread evenly across the country, nor in each province.</li> </ul> <p>If, for argument's sake, only 1% of Canada's population gets severe symptoms from a SARS-CoV-2 infection at around the same time, that's 370,000 people. Our entire health care system would collapse under the weight. That's why we need to flatten the curve. Everything we're doing is about managing load and slowing the spread. Vaccines are over a year away, SARS-CoV-2 is not going to disappear in that time period.</p> <h2 id=how-soap-kills-the-coronavirus>How Soap Kills The Coronavirus</h2> <p>Vox has a nice little video explaining how simple soap is a critical tool during this pandemic.</p> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/-LKVUarhtvE width=560></iframe> <h2 id=how-germs-spread>How Germs Spread</h2> <p>Mark Rober has an excellent video that will help you visualize the spread of germs.</p> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/I5-dI74zxPg width=560></iframe> <h2 id=ted-interview-with-bill-gates>TED Interview With BIll Gates</h2> <p>Bill Gates on how we must respond to the pandemic.gu</p> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xe8fIjxicoo width=560></iframe> <h2 id=why-new-diseases-keep-appearing-in-china>Why New Diseases Keep Appearing In China</h2> <p>Vox has an explainer on why zoonotic viruses keep appearing in China.</p> <iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen frameborder=0 height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/TPpoJGYlW54 width=560></iframe> <p>A couple of important notes:</p> <ol> <li><strong><a href=https://www.latimes.com/food/story/2020-03-11/coronavirus-china-wet-markets>Not all wet markets are wildlife wet markets.</a></strong></li> <li>If you are looking to allocate responsibility, <strong>focus on the policies that allow wildlife markets to exist, and the small number of individuals/entities responsible for those policies</strong>.

Right now, I don't get the perception that most people realize that *they will likely get the virus at some point*, and are somewhat dismissive of social distancing efforts. Social distancing efforts in the west right now are all about managing load on the health care system.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FdSQztKXR6k0\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\nAs it relates to health care capacity in Canada:\n\n* As of 2018, [Canada has a population of ~37M people](https:\u002F\u002Fdata.worldbank.org\u002Findicator\u002FSP.POP.TOTL)\n* For that population, [Canada has 5000 ventilators spread across the country](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.cbc.ca\u002Fnews\u002Fhealth\u002Fcanada-covid-19-coronavirus-spread-hospital-surge-capacity-ventilators-1.5493178)\n* As of 2017, [Canada has 2.52 beds per 1,000 people](https:\u002F\u002Fen.wikipedia.org\u002Fwiki\u002FList_of_countries_by_hospital_beds), a number that has been steadily declining. Globally, we're ranked 36th in this metric. For comparison, China has 4.34\u002F1000, Italy has 3.18\u002F1000. At the top of the list are Japan and Korea, with 13.05\u002F1000 and 12.27\u002F1000, respectively.\n* Keep in mind that many of those hospital beds are already occupied with other illnesses.\n* [As of 2013-2014, it was estimated that Canada had 12.9 adult ICU beds per 100,000 population](https:\u002F\u002Fsecure.cihi.ca\u002Ffree_products\u002FICU_Report_EN.pdf). If you want to extrapolate, that's roughly 4800 adult ICU beds spread across the country. In reality, those beds aren't spread evenly across the country, nor in each province.\n\nIf, for argument's sake, only 1% of Canada's population gets severe symptoms from a SARS-CoV-2 infection at around the same time, that's 370,000 people. Our entire health care system would collapse under the weight. That's why we need to flatten the curve. Everything we're doing is about managing load and slowing the spread. Vaccines are over a year away, SARS-CoV-2 is not going to disappear in that time period.\n\n\n## How Soap Kills The Coronavirus\n\nVox has a nice little video explaining how simple soap is a critical tool during this pandemic.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002F-LKVUarhtvE\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n## How Germs Spread\n\nMark Rober has an excellent video that will help you visualize the spread of germs.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FI5-dI74zxPg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n\n## TED Interview With BIll Gates\n\nBill Gates on how we must respond to the pandemic.gu\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FXe8fIjxicoo\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\n## Why New Diseases Keep Appearing In China\n\nVox has an explainer on why zoonotic viruses keep appearing in China.\n\n\u003Ciframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.youtube.com\u002Fembed\u002FTPpoJGYlW54\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen\u003E\u003C\u002Fiframe\u003E\n\nA couple of important notes:\n\n1. **[Not all wet markets are wildlife wet markets.](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.latimes.com\u002Ffood\u002Fstory\u002F2020-03-11\u002Fcoronavirus-china-wet-markets)**\n2.
