Thanks to Cmder, it has not.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://getgreenshot.org/ >Greenshot</a></strong> - I use this for screen grabs and annotating them. If you miss Skitch, you'll like Greenshot a lot.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://1password.com/ >1Password</a></strong> - Everyone should use a password manager these days. This is on my list <em>begrudgingly</em>. It is far from perfect, especially for Windows and Android users. I can't say I'm 100% happy with the service, but I have yet to see another cross-platform password manager that has a better user experience on the platforms that matter to me.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft Edge (Chromium)</strong> - this is still in beta at the time of writing, but it will be pushed down in an update to Windows users in early 2020. I was on Chrome for the longest time, but it's a battery suck and resource hog. The fact that the developer tools are the same as Chrome's made the switch a no-brainer for me.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.autohotkey.com/ >AutoHotkey</a></strong> - I use this for text expansion primarily, but it's a powerful tool that can do much more.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://atom.io/ >Atom</a></strong> - While there are better and faster editors, I find the overall functionality of Atom to outweigh its many negatives. I use this application most of the day, for everything from writing code to editing text documents.</li> <li><strong><a href=http://tightvnc.net/ >TightVNC</a></strong> - It sucks that Windows remote desktop is disabled for Windows Home machines. Since I have a bunch of machines that I use for testing and development, TightVNC is a handy substitute for RDP on machines that don't support it.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://wol.aquilatech.com/ >WakeOnLan</a></strong> - If you've got a bunch of computers that you don't need to run 24/7, WakeOnLan is a handy GUI based tool for waking them up.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.dropbox.com/ >Dropbox</a></strong> - This one's probably a controversial one, since Dropbox's new client is a disaster in so many regards, but Dropbox is something that just makes my life easier with respect to my most important data. I miss the "good old days" of Dropbox, when it wasn't trying to do so much, but I do get my money's worth for my subscription.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.7-zip.org/ >7zip</a></strong> - At some point, everyone's going to need to unzip some compressed archive. I'm not a fan of the built-in Windows zip decompression, and 7zip is an excellent alternative.</li> <li><strong><a href=http://www.classicshell.net/gallery/Classic-Explorer>Classic Explorer</a></strong> - I have hated the tweaks to Windows Explorer that Microsoft made after Windows 2000. Classic Explorer lets you change the look and feel of Windows Explorer to feel like older versions.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.displayfusion.com/ >DisplayFusion</a></strong> - If you've got multiple monitors, DisplayFusion is a godsend. It's not free, but it goes on sale on <a href=https://store.steampowered.com/ >Steam</a> regularly (which is also the best way to buy it, because of the more relaxed licensing).</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.stardock.com/products/groupy/ >Groupy</a></strong> - This inexpensive utility lets you group multiple windows from multiple apps into a single tabbed window. It will at some point be replaced by a built-in Windows feature, but I've been using it for several months, and Microsoft has delayed implementing that feature into Windows, so I still recommend buying it.</li> <li><strong><a href=http://www.codesector.com/directfolders>DirectFolders</a></strong> - This indispensable, inexpensive utility powers up your Windows Explorer experience. It makes it very easy to jump to commonly used folders.</li> </ul> <h1 id=machine-provisioning>Machine Provisioning</h1> <p>When setting up new Windows machines, the first thing I do is install go to <a href=https://ninite.com/ >Ninite</a> and get a customized installer.

It can also compare the contents of two folders, which is handy.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.sublimetext.com/ >Sublime Text</a></strong> - Even though I use Atom as my primary editor, I love Sublime Text. I still use it regularly, and it's good enough that I'll probably buy every major update that they release. It's fast, powerful and cross-platform. Gotta love it.</li> </ul> <h1 id=development-tools>Development Tools</h1> <ul> <li><strong><a href=http://www.ldapadmin.org/ >LDAPAdmin</a></strong> - Handy for setting up an LDAP server for testing.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://nodejs.org/en/ >NodeJS</a></strong> - My go-to tool for writing automation scripts.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://insomnia.rest/ >Insomnia REST Client</a></strong> - A tool for testing REST API calls.

I use this for testing webhooks.</li> <li><strong><a href=https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/ >Sourcetree</a></strong> - A GUI for Git.

I have a love\u002Fhate relationship with Onenote, but it is a good tool.\r\n\r\n# Text Editing\r\n\r\n* **[PilotEdit](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.pilotedit.com\u002Findex.html)** - is a handy tool for examining gigantic text files.\r\n* **[WinMerge](https:\u002F\u002Fwinmerge.org\u002F)** - A great tool for comparing diffs between two texts files. It can also compare the contents of two folders, which is handy.\r\n* **[Sublime Text](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sublimetext.com\u002F)** - Even though I use Atom as my primary editor, I love Sublime Text. I still use it regularly, and it's good enough that I'll probably buy every major update that they release. It's fast, powerful and cross-platform. Gotta love it.\r\n\r\n# Development Tools\r\n\r\n* **[LDAPAdmin](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.ldapadmin.org\u002F)** - Handy for setting up an LDAP server for testing.\r\n* **[NodeJS](https:\u002F\u002Fnodejs.org\u002Fen\u002F)** - My go-to tool for writing automation scripts.\r\n* **[Insomnia REST Client](https:\u002F\u002Finsomnia.rest\u002F)** - A tool for testing REST API calls. I prefer this over Postman.\r\n* **[ngrok](https:\u002F\u002Fngrok.com\u002F)** - A tool that can expose a local machine to the Internet. I use this for testing webhooks.\r\n* **[Sourcetree](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sourcetreeapp.com\u002F)** - A GUI for Git. I don't use this anymore, as Atom has a built-in Git client, but this is a good client for those who don't want to use the CLI.\r\n* **[Vagrant](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.vagrantup.com\u002F)** - Useful for spinning up reusable VMs for development\r\n* **Windows Subsystem for Linux** - Available with multiple distributions, this handy tool from Microsoft lets you have access to real Linux without having to deal with VMs.\r\n* **Steps Recorder** - Another built in Windows feature that will record a bunch of screenshots and save it as an MHT file. Great for documenting reproducible bugs.\r\n* **[extractMHT](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fbambucode\u002FextractMHT)** - Useful for extracting screenshots out of a Steps Recorder MHT file.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Database Tools\r\n\r\n* **[DBVisualizer](https:\u002F\u002Fdbvis.com\u002F)** - Available as a limited free version, I like this cross-platform database querying tool.\r\n* **[Pentaho Data Integration](https:\u002F\u002Fwiki.pentaho.com\u002Fdisplay\u002FCOM\u002FCommunity+Edition+Downloads)** - A free ETL tool. It's a little crufty, but it works.\r\n* **[Scriptella](http:\u002F\u002Fscriptella.org\u002F)** - A file and command line based ETL tool.\r\n* **[Flyway](https:\u002F\u002Fflywaydb.org\u002F)** - A database migration tool that's easy to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n# General Productivity\r\n\r\n* **[Treesheets](http:\u002F\u002Fstrlen.com\u002Ftreesheets\u002F)** - This is an interesting tool that's not easy to explain. It's like a hiearachical spreadsheet.\r\n* **Office 365** - For interoperability of \"Office\" type documents, I find that nothing beats Microsoft Office. The 365 service has some annoying quirks, but the positives outweigh the negatives.\r\n* **[SumatraPDF](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.sumatrapdfreader.org\u002Ffree-pdf-reader.html)** - A nice lightweight PDF reader. It also supports eBooks, CHM and comic book formats.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Graphics\u002FDrawing\r\n\r\n* **[Drawio Desktop](https:\u002F\u002Fgithub.com\u002Fjgraph\u002Fdrawio-desktop)** - A free alternative to Visio\r\n* **[Affinity Photo](https:\u002F\u002Faffinity.serif.com\u002Fen-gb\u002Fphoto\u002F)** - An affordable alternative to Photoshop that goes on sale regularly\r\n* **[Affinity Designer](https:\u002F\u002Faffinity.serif.com\u002Fen-gb\u002Fdesigner\u002F)** - An affordable alternative to Illustrator that goes on sale regularly. This is the first app that I've used that can open Illustrator files reliably.\r\n* **[DxO Photolab](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.dxo.com\u002Fdxo-photolab\u002F)** - A reasonably priced, non-subscription alternative to Lightroom for RAW processing. This gets heavily discounted around Black Friday and Christmas every year, so I wouldn't recommend buying it at other times of the year unless you absolutely need it.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Collaboration Tools\r\n\r\n* **[Slack](https:\u002F\u002Fslack.com\u002F)** - Slack is still my preferred collaboration tool.\r\n* **[Skype](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.skype.com\u002Fen\u002F)** - I have a love\u002Fhate relationship with Skype, but it's still a very useful tool in my repertoire.\r\n* **[Teamviewer](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.teamviewer.com\u002Fen-us\u002F)** - Not a huge fan of the tool but in a pinch, it's handy for remote sessions.\r\n\r\n# Media\r\n\r\n* **[Musicbee](https:\u002F\u002Fgetmusicbee.com\u002F)** - A good audio player for your music library.\r\n* **[PotPlayer](https:\u002F\u002Fdaumpotplayer.com\u002Fdownload\u002F)** - A good media player for music and videos.\r\n* **[Handbrake](https:\u002F\u002Fhandbrake.fr\u002F)** - A useful tool for recompressing videos\r\n* **[Audacity](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.audacityteam.org\u002F)** - A free multi-track audio editor\r\n* **[Video Editor]** - Included with recent versions of Windows, this is a \"modern\" version of Windows Movie Maker. It's not that powerful, but good for quick cuts. While I have purchased various non-linear video editors, I have yet to encounter something that I can wholeheartedly recommend.\r\n* **[OBS Studio](https:\u002F\u002Fobsproject.com\u002F)** - OBS Studio is a passable free tool for screen recording. It has a quirky user interface that takes getting used to, but it works.\r\n* **[ScreenToGif](https:\u002F\u002Fwww.screentogif.com\u002F)** - Like OBS Studio, except hat it records to an animated GIF.\r\n* **[MyAudioBookReader](https:\u002F\u002Fdownload.cnet.com\u002FMy-Audiobook-Reader\u002F3000-2139_4-75452185.html)** - A rudimentary player for listening to audio books.\r\n\r\n\r\n# Other\r\n\r\n* **[FutureTax](http:\u002F\u002Fwww.futuretax.ca\u002Fnetfile\u002Findex.php)** - I only use this Canadian tax software once a year, but it's great for the price.\r\n* **[Joy2Key](https:\u002F\u002Fjoytokey.net\u002Fen\u002F)** - Allows you to map functions to a game controller. This has more practical applications than you'd think, especially if you're doing things that involve repetitive keystrokes.\r\n",html:"\u003Ch1 id=\"introduction\"\u003EIntroduction\u003C\u002Fh1\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWelcome to my frequently updated list of Windows software that I use to stay productive.
