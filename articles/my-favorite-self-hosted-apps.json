I may at some point switch to Traefik or something else, but haven't because of inertia.\r\n\r\n## Directory Server\r\n\r\n* **OpenLDAP** (osixia/openldap:1.2.5) - Good for creating a test LDAP instance for testing\r\n\r\n## Database Servers\r\n\r\n* **Postgresql** (postgres) - My favorite relational DB.\r\n* **SQL Server** (microsoft/mssql-server-linux:2017-latest) - Microsoft SQL Server 2017\r\n* **DB2** (ibmcom/db2) - Possibly the easiest and most painless way to install an instance of DB2\r\n* **Mysql** (mysql) - I don't really use this, but handy for development.\r\n* **MongoDB** (mongodb) - For web scale data storage /s\r\n* **CouchDB** (apache/couchdb:latest) - A document store. a.k.a. Cloudant\r\n\r\n## Applications\r\n\r\n* **Gitlab** (gitlab/gitlab-ce:latest) - I use this to host private Git repositories locally. Think of it as a host-your-own Github/Gitlab.\r\n* **Wallabag** (wallabag/wallabag) - Wallabag is like Pocket. I use it to collect articles for reference or to read later.\r\n* **PGAdmin4** (pgadmin4) - Administration tool for Postgresql.\r\n* **OpenHAB** (openhab/openhab:2.4.0) - Smart Home controller. I was not a fan of Home Assistant. I may still end up either writing my own solution, or switching to Node-Red.\r\n\r\n## Probationary Applications\r\n\r\nThese are applications I'm currently trying out:\r\n\r\n* **Jenkins** (jenkins/jenkins:lts) - Continuous Integration server. I have this installed, but I'm not 100% sold on it as the right tool for me.\r\n* **Huginn** (huginn/huginn) - It's like a host-your-own IFTTT. I'm not 100% sold on this yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Tried, But Didn't Make The Cut\r\n\r\nSome containers I tried but they just weren't for me in one shape or form.\r\n\r\n* **Wiki.js** - This one shows a lot of promise. It's just not ready for prime time for me. I'll probably give this another shot in the future. I would still choose WikiJS in its current state over Bookstack though.\r\n* **Gogs** - Another self-hosted Git server. I personally found Gitlab to have more complete functionality combined with a nicer UI.\r\n* **Bookstack** - A documentation/wiki type of app. I tried this *twice* based on its popularity on [/r/selfhosted](https://www.reddit.com/r/selfhosted/), and it just wasn't for me.\r\n* **Verdaccio** - A self hosted private NPM registry. Once I found out that Github was providing a free private NPM registry, it had no use for me.\r\n* **Home Assistant** - A smart home application. I did not like this at all and ended up switching to OpenHAB.\r\n",
